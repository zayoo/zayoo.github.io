///These series of work aimed at using different materials to express. As a music lover, what I wanted to express was the “rhythm” by using material which was not relevant with it. I chose screw, turnbuckle, string and silk stockings, which formed the braille of different songs that can be read by blind people. They can feel the heave of rhythm by touching different materials, which provides another angle of intervention.{@}///These materials are recycled waste ones, and I selected some of them to reconstruct it with a conception of "waste stuff can also produce beauty and make sound". Actually, it really does.

///One day when I read the record of mistakes when playing different pieces in my childhood, an idea came up to me. "Why can't I gather all the mistakes together and turn the 'error' into something 'right'?"{@}///Then I selected 10 songs, remarked the errors and eventually generate a new melody. I chose rubbing as visual presentation, connecting each part with the wrong fingering.{@}///The design of my book is divided into four parts. The first part is the visual representation of the melody, where the time line is based on units of seconds. The second part is the "mistake" I made, mainly about the mark on the music book. The third part is the photo on which I was playing the piano when I was a kid. The fourth part is the changing rhythm of the melody in different time periods; it is summarized in three main types inserted according to the order of the rhythm between the corresponding page. The four parts are interleaved manner, and eventually returned to a point. This point is re-understanding of the wrong.

///This book called "Changing Cloud as I am" is made up of 3 photos of cloud. I chose 3 photos and reconstructed them which lead to 40 outcomes. Each outcome relates to a certain unit of time which composes the main body of the book. There is an invisible reticular structure behind the visual presentation.{@}///I cut time into several pieces of units. You can see the changing of speed in each unit; you can also see the changing of density of time in each unit. 5 main units of time lead to 40 different possibilities. Dot symbolizes musical note, line symbolizes lasting time of the musical element, so the viewer can put any tone or sound they like into this "structure of time" that leads to different outcomes which becomes the "Cloud Sonata" of their own.

///This project is to redesign Enya's album "A Day Without Rain", the album mainly shows the process from a sunny day to rainy. Combined with natural, fresh, ethereal, resonant characteristics, I made it in a purer way to express the spirit of the album. I used sulfuric acid paper; it generated a hazy sense which matches the theme. The cover is full of superimposed layers so that the text dislocated. Inside pages are more loosely organized, which is derived from Enya's music style: no ups and downs, no climax, the overall sense is in a free loose structure throughout the entire album.

It is a mixture of tears, disappointment, fear and frustration. However, the light has always been in your own heart as long as you believe. With belief, we overcome the obstacles and finally reach our goals. So "light" has become the clue of the whole album, which is the symbol of hope.

///The design concept of the album is mainly about the relationship between dreams and memories. Memory is selective, with the passage of time it may lose parts of the information and it may also be added in a number of untrue contents. This album is started with two lines of both dream and memory. The main line of the album is made by 10 pieces of piano music. The rhythm, which was made up with the first letter that is enlarged of the word “Dreamland” together with the dots match to the style of each music.{@}///The name of each song is lead out by the last drop of dot. Memories and dreams are inseparable. Who can deny that our memory does not contain the ingredients of dream and the dream is not constituted by every section of memory. However, the text at the beginning is gradually becoming blurred over time which shows the characteristic of memory, this is the other line. The two lines combined organically, which has become the main framework of the album.

Some are calm and peaceful, some are sharp and cold, some are jumping and lively, some are silent and dark...each of them has its own character. You can trace the whole melody with the position of each note.

///This project was a package design for a Chinese rice paper brand called "Qiannianguxuan". As the Chinese rice paper is made in two years’ time as a cycle, which has been following a traditional Chinese rice paper making technics. So the brand should be a noble, decent and primitive style. For that reason, I chose the pine tree as the pattern in all directions, which became a symbol of the series of characteristics in traditional Chinese culture. In addition, I made use of the form of Chinese ancient book as a carrier of the package. This work attended the 2010 Asian Expo later on.

///This poster was a trail of the combination of the ancient Chinese element and the modern one. I chose the work of one of the well-known ancient Chinese painter in Qing dynasty called Badashanren. This piece described a rainy day with breeze in a very peaceful lotus pond. I used missile in replace of the rain, you can also find out that there are planes instead of the dragonfly and tank instead of the insects in the new image. What I try to express is the big crisis under the peaceful image, the harmony on surface is fake. So the cross in the end of the image is kind of a reminder for human crime.

///In this age of commodity economy and economic globalization, all the things we use daily have been posted on various "label", the identity of people is being defined and classified by various brands with different levels. The era that all things are from the hands of skilled craftsmen in traditional culture has gone forever. If one day, when you come to village and find out that the "door-god" which is regarded as the patron saint by common people has been "packaged" with a variety of international brands, what is your reaction? Traditional Chinese beliefs and values are gradually disappearing from people's vision as our culture now. What kind of mood will you be when you see that in the back of the world famous brands printed with "Made in China" label? Where is our culture now? Perhaps this is the very issue that deserves our attention in this age.

My Chinese name is "Yue Yichuan".It means mountain, water and creek, which has close relationship with our nature. In the ancient Chinese history, a lot of scholars were used to put their emotions and feelings into the nature---especially the mountains and water. Lucky cloud is widely used in the traditional Chinese paper-cut art as company of water, so that is what I selected as a symbol to convey the meaning of my name in a direct way.

///The work "Quartet" is composed of 4 parts, "conversion, ablation, nested and stranded". It starts from one point and returns to itself eventually in circle. Four colours indicate different state of life of modern people. It is aimed at reproduce the oppression and remodeling process of modern industrializing society to modern people's spiritual world through mechanical repetition. It shows a section of modern people's life. Each part has a fixed rhythm and move on with its own frequency. The rhythm of each part is quite tedious. Only when the four parts get together can it forms a complete and rich rhythm. The Africa conga drum is chosen to be the orchestration; it is the production of primitive society. Perhaps, only in the most primitive rhythm can we be able to feel the real rhythm of modern society.
